!!!! i did change it to YES!!!
#You have chosen to not have conda modify your shell scripts at all.
#To activate conda's base environment in your current shell session:

#eval "$(/Users/josephineconnelly/mambaforge/bin/conda shell.YOUR_SHELL_NAME hook)" 

#To install conda's shell functions for easier access, first activate, then:

#conda init

#If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup, 
#   set the auto_activate_base parameter to false: 

#con false

#Thank you for installing Mambaforge!
#Mamba instead of conda? https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba

mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake

#
# To activate this environment, use
